Responds to insults and good manners


## About

### Acknowledge and Appreciate Good Manners in Others
Manners are reciprocal. If someone holds a door, say thank you. If you need something from
a grocery shelf, and someone else is in the way, say "excuse me, please." Or ask them
"could you please hand me a box of that cereal?" and then thank them.

### Why Do We Need Manners?
Manners make the world go 'round. They are to the smooth functioning of society as oil is
to an engine.
Without good manners, people get offended, hurt, and in extreme cases, very bad manners
can lead to things such as the all-too-familiar public shootings, and even wars between
countries when some official protocol is snubbed.

This skill monitor utterances and reprimand insults / foul language, show appreciation for good manners
